# AdventOfCode

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
Advent of Code is created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).

### It's not advent yet, why are you doing this?
I just discovered these challenges and hope to be through with the past ones by Advent.
